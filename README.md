Repository for dev of site. Uses fullpage.js

- Install https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-webapp
- Create the directory structure so that the bootstap.scss file is within the app (and can be edited) rather than in node_modules.
- Comment out any of the bootstrap components that aren't needed
- Install fullpage.js
- A way you go!

Notes
-----
- Careful where ou add things to the header - e.g. Google fonts, you can break the dist
